This file contains questions that will be processed later.
==========================================================

- Where are the generic C library files (from the C language - the MAIN ones - not libc ones - as for example 'stdarg.h') ?
- Where are defined - and what is the code behing (are they libc functions ?) - basic functions as ?
  	- 'exec'
	- 'fclose'
	- 'fopen'
	- 'getc'
	- 'printf' (stdio.h)
	- 'putc'
	- 'scanf'

- Where are defined the types 'valist' (see variadic functions) ?

- How is the C language interpreted by the compiler ?
- How does the compiler know the meaning of the C keywords ?
- Where are the keywords defined ?
- Where are defined the basic types 'int' and 'char' ?

- Where is defined '__noreturn__' (see '_exit' function within 'unistd.h') ?
- Where is defined the word (or macro or else) 'type' (used in stddef.h in libc) ?

- How to create a dynamic variable name, for example : I want to loop on an array of variable names and get their value -> how to do it ?
      Array = [ "char", "int"]
      I want to get the sizeof(char) and sizeof(int).
      See the file "types_and_number_of_bits.c" to loop on array of all types to get their size.
