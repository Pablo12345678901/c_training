This file contains questions that will be processed later.
==========================================================

- Where are the generic C library files (from the C language - the MAIN ones - not libc ones - as for example 'stdarg.h') ?

- How is the C language interpreted by the compiler ?
- How does the compiler know the meaning of the C keywords ?
- Where are the keywords defined ?
- Where are defined the basic types 'int' and 'char' ?

- Where is defined '__noreturn__' (see '_exit' function within 'unistd.h') ?
