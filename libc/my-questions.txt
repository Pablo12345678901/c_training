==========================================================

- Where are the generic C library files (from the C language - the MAIN ones - not libc ones - as for example 'stdarg.h') ?
- Where are defined - and what is the code behing (are they libc functions ?) - basic functions as ?
  	- 'exec'
	- 'fclose'
	- 'fopen'
	- 'getc'
	- 'printf' (stdio.h)
	- 'putc'
	- 'scanf'

- Where are defined the types 'valist' (see variadic functions) ?

- How is the C language interpreted by the compiler ?
- How does the compiler know the meaning of the C keywords ?
- Where are the keywords defined ?
- Where are defined the basic types 'int' and 'char' ?

- Where is defined '__noreturn__' (see '_exit' function within 'unistd.h') ?
